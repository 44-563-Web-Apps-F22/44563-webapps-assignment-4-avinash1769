            <h4 style="color:darkgoldenrod">CELIA.</h4> Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished
            Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4>  Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland.  Why, she
            wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!  We sing her songs
            and we trip her measures, but we don't enjoy ourselves!<br>
            <h4><span>FLETA.</span></h4>  To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
            she was banished!  What could she have done to have deserved so
            terrible a punishment?<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4>  Something awful!  She married a mortal!<br>
            <h4><span>FLETA</span>.</h4> Oh!  Is it injudicious to marry a mortal?<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4>  Injudicious?  It strikes at the root of the whole
            fairy system!  By our laws, the fairy who marries a mortal dies!<br>
            <h4 style="color:darkgoldenrod">CELIA.</h4>  But Iolanthe didn't die!<br>
          
             <p> (Enter Fairy Queen.)</p><br>
          
            <h4><Mark> QUEEN.</Mark></h4>  No, because your Queen, who loved her with a
            surpassing love, commuted her sentence to penal servitude for life,
            on condition that she left her husband and never communicated with
            him again!<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4> That sentence of penal servitude she is now working
            out, on her head, at the bottom of that stream!<br>
            <h4><Mark>QUEEN</Mark></h4>  Yes, but when I banished her, I gave her all the
            pleasant places of the earth to dwell in.  I'm sure I never
            intended that she should go and live at the bottom of a stream!  It
            makes me perfectly wretched to think of the discomfort she must
            have undergone!<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4> Think of the damp!  And her chest was always delicate.<br>
            <h4><Mark>QUEEN</Mark></h4> And the frogs!  Ugh!  I never shall enjoy any peace of
            mind until I know why Iolanthe went to live among the frogs!<br>
            <h4><span>FLETA</span></h4> Then why not summon her and ask her?<br>
            <h4><Mark>QUEEN</Mark></h4> Why?  Because if I set eyes on her I should forgive
            her at once!<br>
            <h4 style="color:darkgoldenrod">CELIA.</h4>  Then why not forgive her?  Twenty-five years—it's a
            long time!<br>
            <h4>LEILA</h4>Think how we loved her!<br>
            <h4><Mark>QUEEN</Mark></h4> Loved her?  What was your love to mine?  Why, she was
            invaluable to me!  Who taught me to curl myself inside a buttercup?
            Iolanthe!  Who taught me to swing upon a cobweb?  Iolanthe!  Who
            taught me to dive into a dewdrop—to nestle in a nutshell—to
            gambol upon gossamer?  Iolanthe!<br>
            <h4>LEILA.</h4>She certainly did surprising things!<br>
            <h4><span>FLETA</span></h4>  Oh, give her back to us, great Queen, for your sake if
            not for ours!  <p>(All kneel in supplication.)</p><br>
            <h4><Mark>QUEEN</Mark></h4> <p> (irresolute).</p>  Oh, I should be strong, but I am weak!
            I should be marble, but I am clay!  Her punishment has been heavier
            than I intended.  I did not mean that she should live among the
            frogs—and—well, well, it shall be as you wish—it shall be as you
            wish!

                 Good morrow, good lover!<br>
                      Good lover, good morrow!<br>
                 I prithee discover,<br>
                      Steal, purchase, or borrow<br>
             Some means of concealing<br>
                 The care you are feeling,<br>
                And join in a measure<br>
                    Expressive of pleasure,<br>
                 For we're to be married to-day—to-day!<br>
                    Yes, we're to be married to-day!<br>
